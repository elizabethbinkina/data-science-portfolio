Introduction"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"U9plo5Eycglo"},"source":["Professor Karle Flanagan tasked us to build a model that will optimize her STAT 107 course staff schedule for the Spring 2025 semester that she anticipates will have 41 lab sessions, 21 teaching assistants and 50 course assistants. For this project, she gave us her current Fall 2024 semester scheduling system, so our model will be based off of this data.\n","\n","Karle's current process is inefficient and tedious with numerous spreadsheets and a preference score system that she estimates takes 8 to 10 hours to complete. She would like a faster way to create her schedule and make sure students like the shifts they are assigned to.\n","\n","Our model formulation is based off of classic scheduling problems that we learned in STAT 430. It requires information about the availability of each person, and in Karle's case, the preference scores as well. These parameters can easily be modeled as binary variables, which means yes/no response. For example: Is the CA available = yes/no, prefers this shift = yes/no?\n","\n","We were able to create a scheduling model that meets Karle's main goals and create spreadsheets for assigned shifts by shift and assigned shifts by individual similar to the data Karle gave us. The model also gives some useful metrics such as the percentage of preferences met."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tbJ42YZ0cglp"},"source":["## 2. Problem"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SaSaknD6cglp"},"source":["The main goal is to maximize the student teaching assistant (TA) and course assistant (CA) availability preferences for lab and office hour shifts and meet at least 90% of their preferences. The client also wished to meet the TA contract hour requirements of each TA working 2 to 3 lab shifts and exactly 1 office hour shift, and the guarantee of CAs working 4-6 hours/week to be the most important.\n","\n","The optimization problem in our model required some stipulations due to the nature of the data. We are unable to ensure that some days are simply more popular than others for the course staff to mark as available, so we did not include Karle's request that more staff be assigned on busy days. Though Karle did not give this soft constraint, we had to set upper limits on number of each type of staff for office hour shifts to prevent one shift from having over 20 staff working in it. This is a flexible constraint that can be adjusted depending on Karle's needs.\n","\n","Another stipulation is that we ignored the notes students gave on the spreadsheet Karle gave us because students sometimes voiced conflicting information on what they wanted and what they filled out on the schedule sheet.\n","\n","According to our client, Karle, she found these goals and stipulations to be the most important: nobody is assigned to a shift they are not available for and that each shift meets the minimum staffing requirements. She considered the maximum caps of number of CAs and TAs assigned to office hours and labs to be flexible."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Q5_EjKrhcglq"},"source":["## 3.
