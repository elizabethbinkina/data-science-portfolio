AIRBNB PROJECT 
This project explores how features of Airbnb listings predict nightly prices in the Los Angeles area. Using datasets from Kaggle and Inside Airbnb, we focused on attributes like bathrooms, bedrooms, accommodates, and neighborhood. After cleaning the data and applying a log transformation to price, we found accommodates to be the strongest predictor. Techniques such as regression, PCA, clustering, and structural equation modeling confirmed that property size and guest capacity significantly influence price. Neighborhood had limited impact. The findings can help hosts set competitive prices and aid travelers in budgeting, though results are specific to Los Angeles and not globally generalizable.

CA AND TA SCEDULE OPTIMIZATION PROJECT

This project aimed to optimize the scheduling of Course Assistants (CAs) and Teaching Assistants (TAs) for the STAT 107 course at the University of Illinois. Tasked by Professor Karle Flanagan, the goal was to develop a scheduling model that satisfies each staff member’s availability, maximizes shift preference satisfaction, and adheres to role-specific workload requirements. The model incorporates staff availability and preferences using binary variables and ensures that each shift meets minimum and maximum staffing needs while avoiding scheduling conflicts. Built using Python and the PuLP linear programming package, the solution replaces a previously manual, spreadsheet-based process that required 8–10 hours of effort. The optimized model produced a schedule in under a second, fulfilling 92.55% of staff preferences and assigning all shifts while honoring all constraints. Outputs included clear, organized schedules by shift and staff member. The model is highly adaptable for future semesters and has potential for broader academic scheduling applications.

HOSPITAL OPERATIONS OPTIMIZATION PROJECT 

This project addresses the integrated assignment of patients to rooms (PRA) and nurses to patients (NPA) within hospital wards using real-world and synthetic data. Based on the work of Brandt et al. (2023), the project formulates the problem as a large-scale mixed-integer program (MIP) and explores heuristic approaches for faster solutions. The model aims to optimize multiple, often competing objectives: minimizing patient transfers, gender mixing, equipment mismatches, nurse walking distances, and workload imbalances, while ensuring patient needs and preferences are met. By integrating PRA and NPA rather than optimizing them separately, the model improves hospital operational efficiency, patient care quality, and staff satisfaction. Constraints account for capacity limits, fair nurse workload distribution, age and gender compatibility, skill-level requirements, and spatial logistics. Results from synthetic and real datasets show the heuristic solution provides a strong balance of speed and accuracy, making it ideal for practical hospital use, especially in short-stay ward planning.
