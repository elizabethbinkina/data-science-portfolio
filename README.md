AirBnb Project: 
This project explores how features of Airbnb listings predict nightly prices in the Los Angeles area. Using datasets from Kaggle and Inside Airbnb, we focused on attributes like bathrooms, bedrooms, accommodates, and neighborhood. After cleaning the data and applying a log transformation to price, we found accommodates to be the strongest predictor. Techniques such as regression, PCA, clustering, and structural equation modeling confirmed that property size and guest capacity significantly influence price. Neighborhood had limited impact. The findings can help hosts set competitive prices and aid travelers in budgeting, though results are specific to Los Angeles and not globally generalizable.
