AIRBNB PROJECT 

This project explores how features of Airbnb listings predict nightly prices in the Los Angeles area. Focused on attributes like bathrooms, bedrooms, accommodates, and neighborhood. After cleaning the data and applying a log transformation to price, found that accommodates to be the strongest predictor. Techniques such as regression, PCA, clustering, and structural equation modeling confirmed that property size and guest capacity significantly influence price. Neighborhood had limited impact. The findings can help hosts set competitive prices and aid travelers in budgeting in Los Angelos. 

CA AND TA SCEDULE OPTIMIZATION PROJECT

This project succesfully optimized the scheduling of Course Assistants (CAs) and Teaching Assistants (TAs) for the STAT 107 course at the University of Illinois. Tasked by Professor Karle Flanagan, the goal was to develop a scheduling model that satisfies each staff member’s availability, maximizes shift preference satisfaction, and adheres to role-specific workload requirements. The model incorporates staff availability and preferences using binary variables and ensures that each shift meets minimum and maximum staffing needs while avoiding scheduling conflicts. Built using Python and the PuLP linear programming package, the solution replaces a previously manual, spreadsheet-based process that required 8–10 hours of effort. The optimized model produced a schedule in under a second, fulfilling 92.55% of staff preferences and assigning all shifts while honoring all constraints. Outputs included clear, organized schedules by shift and staff member. The model is highly adaptable for future semesters and has potential for broader academic scheduling applications.

HOSPITAL OPERATIONS OPTIMIZATION PROJECT 

This project addresses the integrated assignment of patients to rooms (PRA) and nurses to patients (NPA) within hospital wards using real-world and synthetic data. Based on the work of Brandt et al. (2023), the project formulates the problem as a large-scale mixed-integer program (MIP) and explores heuristic approaches for faster solutions. The model aims to optimize multiple, often competing objectives: minimizing patient transfers, gender mixing, equipment mismatches, nurse walking distances, and workload imbalances, while ensuring patient needs and preferences are met. By integrating PRA and NPA rather than optimizing them separately, the model improves hospital operational efficiency, patient care quality, and staff satisfaction. Constraints account for capacity limits, fair nurse workload distribution, age and gender compatibility, skill-level requirements, and spatial logistics. Results from synthetic and real datasets show the heuristic solution provides a strong balance of speed and accuracy, making it ideal for practical hospital use, especially in short-stay ward planning.

USED CAR SALES MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT 

This project investigates the key factors influencing used car prices through data preprocessing, clustering, and predictive modeling. The dataset, comprising various car attributes such as mileage, age, horsepower, and brand, was cleaned and transformed to extract numerical features from text-heavy entries. Clustering algorithms like K-medoids, complete linkage, and latent class analysis (LCA) were applied to segment the market into meaningful groups—ranging from budget-friendly to luxury vehicles. Regression models including OLS, regression trees, random forest, SVM, and Gaussian boosting were developed to predict car prices, with random forest achieving the highest R² of 0.887. Feature importance analysis revealed horsepower, mileage, and car age as the most influential predictors. The project also explored estimating original car prices using depreciation formulas, accounting for brand-specific rates. This comprehensive analysis offers valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and dealers, enabling data-driven pricing strategies and market segmentation.

NutriChoice 

I was the Team Manager of this Summer 2024 Database Management Project using Cloud Computing. I Led a cross-functional team (3 ppl.) to build a customized ingredient tracking system for users with specific dietary goals/restrictions and constructed a high-volume database with ~50 health-related features using Google Cloud. Designed an ER diagram and optimized SQL queries to manage user data, achieving scalable performance. NutriChoice is a web application that allows for a user to compile a list of food ingredients to buy at the grocery store by inputting dietary goals and preferences. Rather than taking the extra time to research the number of calories in food items or trying to figure out how to increase your protein intake, this application will do it immediately, saving time. Used SQL, Web Development, Cloud Computing, JSON, GitHub. 

TABLEAU DASHBOARD

The Dashboard Project appears is a Tableau-based data visualization initiative focused on analyzing crime statistics in the United States. The project uses data sourced from a Kaggle dataset titled “FBI Crime in the United States”, which includes detailed crime reports compiled by the FBI. The final product is an interactive Tableau dashboard, published here, that  visualizes key crime indicators across different states or time periods. The dashboard enables users to explore trends, compare crime rates, and gain insights into public safety metrics through dynamic charts and filters. This project demonstrates skills in data sourcing, cleaning, and visualization, with a focus on making complex datasets accessible and interpretable for a general audience or policy stakeholders.

DRUG OVERDOSE ANALYSIS IN THE UNITED STATES USING TIME SERIES PROJECT

This project analyzes the alarming rise in drug overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2021 using time series forecasting and regression modeling. Drawing on CDC data, the team explored how demographic factors (age, sex) and drug types influence overdose rates. The analysis began with trend identification, revealing exponential growth in deaths post-2015. An ARIMA(0,2,1) model was fitted to forecast future rates, projecting continued increases through 2026.Two regression models were developed: a main effects model and an interaction model. The main effects model quantified the impact of age, sex, and drug type, identifying middle-aged adults and opioids as key risk factors. The interaction model revealed nuanced relationships, such as specific age-drug combinations that significantly alter risk. Despite limitations in data granularity and variable scope, the project offers critical insights into the overdose epidemic and provides a statistical foundation for public health forecasting and intervention planning.


EXTREME WEATHER TRENDS USING BAYESIAN STATISTICS

This project applies Bayesian hierarchical modeling to analyze global trends in extreme weather events from 2000 to 2024 using environmental data from OpenML. The dataset includes annual records for 18 countries, covering variables such as temperature, CO₂ emissions, sea level rise, and population. The team used a Poisson regression framework with random intercepts and slopes to model country-specific differences and global trends in extreme weather event counts. Exploratory analysis revealed a consistent global increase in extreme weather events, with notable variability across countries. The Bayesian model, implemented in JAGS via R, estimated a global annual increase of approximately 2.8–2.9% in extreme weather events. Posterior diagnostics and sensitivity checks confirmed model robustness and good fit. The study highlights how population size and greenhouse gas emissions correlate with event frequency, and emphasizes the importance of accounting for both global and localized climate dynamics. The findings support the growing urgency of climate resilience and policy intervention.
